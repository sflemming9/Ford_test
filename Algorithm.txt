* General Algorithm For Maze Generation
1. Take command line input of rows and columns
2. Validate inputs
    - Right number of arguments, are they convertable to strings
    - Are they convertable/right type/not too large/not 0, not negative, not empty
3. Treat each point in a row x height grid as a point in the maze, through which we are going to dig
a tunnel using Depth First Search (DFS)
4. Initialize an array to represent all the nodes in the array
    - Allocate memory. Make sure memory was allocated properly
    - Populate array of Nodes that track their row, height, parent, and directions visted
5. Pick a node to start at
6. while all nodes have not been visted chain nodes together by
    - While all directions have not been visted from a node:
        1. Randomly pick a direction and mark it as explored
        2. Depending on the direction chosen check for a direciton that it is possible to go
    - Make sure the direction chosen does not lead into a wall or already have a parent
    = Return node in direction chose or parent's address if it has no other options. Returning the
    address of parent will break out of this loop once all nodes have been visted
