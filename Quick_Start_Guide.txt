* To run the Code: these lines may be executed on any linux based terminal
make; ./maze 5

make all_test

* Reading Documentation
Documentation has been provided in the form of inline documentation, as well as provided .org files 
(a common text markup format) that can be opened and read as though they were text files.

*Language Choice
The C programming language was primarily chosen because the Software Research Engineer position
to which I am applying to will use C. I wanted to showcase my abilities to work with a low level
programming language as this is likely what I would have to do if given the opportunity to work at
Ford. This assignment would have been significantly easier in a modern object oriented language such
as C++ or Python due to the use of prebuilt, dynamically sized, data structures such as stacks,
queues, and vectors.
