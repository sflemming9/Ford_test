* Compiling
Please use the provided makefile. The command "make" will compile an executable of the project.
"make clean" provides the usual behaviour of erasing all compiled files. The makefile was structed
in such a way that it would be able to support a project with increased dependency and complexity in
the future.

* Running 
The program accepts two command line arguments as the rows and columns you want the maze to have. 
Rows and columns must be odd, non negative numbers.

* Testing
See TestCases.txt for more information on test cases. Valid test cases may be ran with
"make all_test" invalid tests must be run individually. For sake of time only simple makefile test
cases were written and I am not familiar with a good C testing framework, and the reccommended time
budget for the assignment did not allow me to learn one. In the future I would prioritize unit and
functional testing given adequate time before the deadline.
