* Current Test Cases
** Valid tests:
1. Test ./maze X where X is an odd number of varying size
2. Test ./maze Y where Y is an odd double; expected to lose the fractional portion

** Invalid tests:
1. Test ./maze X where X is even
2. Test ./maze "str" where the argument is not a number
3. Test ./maze X where X is negative
4. Test ./maze X Y where Y is an extra argument
5. Test ./maze where no arguments are passed

* Future Testing Considerations
- A unit testing framework would be a good addition
- Individually testing the functions, rather than just the final executable
