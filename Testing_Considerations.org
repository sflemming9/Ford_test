* Current Test Cases
** Valid tests:
1. Test ./maze X X where X is an odd number of varying size
2. Test ./maze X Y where X and Y are two odd numbers of varying size
3. Test ./maze X Y where X is an even number and Y is an odd number
4. Test ./maze Y X where Y is an odd number and X is an even number
5. Test ./maze X Y where X and Y are odd doubles; expected to lose the fractional portion

** Invalid tests:
1. Test ./maze X where no second argument is passed, and X is an odd number
2. Test ./maze X "str" where X Is an odd number and the second argument is not a number
3. Test ./maze "str" X where the first argument is not a number and X is an odd number
4. Test ./maze X "str" where X Is an even number and the second argument is not a number
5. Test ./maze "str" X where the first argument is not a number and X is an even number
6. Test ./maze X Y Z where X Y are valid odd numbers

* Future Testing Considerations
- A unit testing framework would be a good addition
- Individually testing the functions, rather than just the final executable would be a good next
  step
