* Current Test Cases
** Valid tests:
1. Test ./maze X Y where X and Y are odd numbers of varying size
2. Test ./maze Z Y where Z is an odd double and Y is an odd int; 
expected to lose the fractional portion
3. Test ./maze Y Z where where Z is an odd double and Y is an odd int; 
expected to lose the fractional portion 

** Invalid tests:
1. Test ./maze X Y where X is even and Y is odd
2. Test ./maze Y X where X is even and Y is odd
3. Test ./maze "str" X where "str" is a string and X is odd
4. Test ./maze X "str" where "str" is a string and X is odd
5. Test ./maze X Y where X is negative and Y is positive
6. Test ./maze Y X  where X is negative and Y is positive
7. Test ./maze X Y Z where z is an extra argument
8. Test ./maze where no arguments are passed
9. Test ./maze X Y where X is 1 and Y is odd
10. Test ./maze X Y where Y is 1 and X is odd

* Future Testing Considerations
- A unit testing framework would be a good addition
- Individually testing the functions, rather than just the final executable
